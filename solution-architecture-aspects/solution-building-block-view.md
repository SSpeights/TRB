# Solution Building Block View

For the design of software solutions, it is important to know their overall structure. For example, a web application may consist of a framework part and customary software components. Knowing about these building blocks is important, for instance,Â  to assess security risks or to judge on the maintainability. For solutions that are provided by external partners, this view is less important.

Diagrams which may be used:

* High-Level component diagram
* Detailed component diagram
* Dataflow diagram.

For development projects, the information given here must answer the following checklist questions:

* What are the main building blocks / components/\(microservices\) developed by the project?
* How can the system be decomposed into individual building blocks \(beyond the system scope\)?
* Are the licenses of 3rd-party libraries and components compatible to ours?
