# Solution Architecture Aspects

This chapter covers all important aspects related to the architecture of your solution and how it is embedded into the Haufe ecosystem. The amount of detail to be delivered here differs largely depending on the type of project. Example: software development projects to integrations of external services and software solutions.

However, each TRB document should cover at least the following topics:

* How is a software solution integrated into our system landscape \(Context Diagram\)?
* What are the main processes supported / facilitated by the solution? Who triggers those processes?
