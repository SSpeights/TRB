# Introduction / Goals 

* [Requirement overview](https://mywiki.grp.haufemg.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=96789650#Introduction/Goals-Requirementoverview)
* [Solution goals](https://mywiki.grp.haufemg.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=96789650#Introduction/Goals-Solutiongoals)



The goal of this chapter is to describe what you're going to do. This may differ for different types of projects:

* For example, if you're about to build a new software solution, you should here describe briefly why you're building this system and what problem it solves.You should also provide the reason why we're building this system ourselves. Also describe any existing, older solutions we have in place.
* If you ask for a review of a solution you want to buy / integrate / obtain a license for Haufe, you should describe what solution it is and most notably what problems it solves. You may also describe how the solution was chosen and so on.

This includes on the one hand, the fulfillment of functional requirements of the stakeholders, and on the other hand, the fulfillment of or compliance with required constraints, always in consideration of the architecture goals

# Requirement overview {#Introduction/Goals-Requirementoverview}

A compact summary of the functional environment of the solution. Answers the following questions \(at least approximately\):

* What are the main business functions realized by the project?
* What are the main requirements solved by the project?
* What happens in the system’s environment?
* Why should the system exist? Why is the system valuable or important? Which problems does the system solve?



# Solution goals {#Introduction/Goals-Solutiongoals}

The top ten goals for the solution and / or constraints for which fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders.

Note that this section only covers technical goals, not project goals – make sure not to confuse these two distinct types of goals.

Goals that define the solution’s quality could be:

* availability
* modifiability
* performance
* security
* testability
* usability
